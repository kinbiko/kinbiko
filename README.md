<h1 align="center">Hello 世界 👋 🌏, I'm Roger (he/him)</h1>
<h3 align="center">An engineering manager and/or software engineer living in Japan</h3>

- ♥️ I value people, improvement of daily work, and short feedback loops.
- 📝 I irregularly write articles on my blog [kinbiko.com](https://kinbiko.com).
- 💬 Ask me about **automated testing**, **developer productivity**, and **mentoring**.

I write open source Go packages and hack on my dotfiles.
I also dream of having my own developer-focused SaaS company one day, but for now I'm focusing on growing my engineering skills and learning Japanese.
