### Hello world 👋 🌏

If you come across `kinbiko` on the internet, that's probably me. You can also call me Roger. He/him.
I'm a 🇳🇴 (but don't like to talk about it) that has lived in 🇺🇸 and 🇬🇧, but now live in 🇯🇵 which is my final destination.

- [🐧 Twitter](https://twitter.com/kinbiko) I mainly use Twitter as a source of images and videos of big dogs.
- [🏠 Blag](https://kinbiko.com): Updates are infrequent.
- [🔗 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinbiko/): I ghost recruiters.
- [🚰 Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kinbiko): I wrote the [github.com/kinbiko/jsonassert](https://github.com/jsonassert) Go testing package on stream.

I value people, improvement of daily work, and short feedback loops.
